# Controlled_Car_Survailance

We used previous tranied efficientnet model for rose disease prediction. 

Controlled bot using website and live streaming using camera. This data is given to the ML model to predict the disease of the plant. And we used `Moisture sensor`,`Humidity sensor`,`Temperature sensor` and we used controls to take the data from the above three sensors. 

Working on autonomous bot.
